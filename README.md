# repair-list
 This is an application that allows users to enter a list of items that are to be repaired.
 list will allow users to enter a descrition of the problem that needs to be fixed. This will add the item to the list below. Users can also check off the items as they are fixed, marking them as completed. Occasionally though, we all make mistakes, that's why we include the ability to remove any individual item from the list completed or not. Additionally, if someone really wanted to, they can clear the entire list with the click of a single button
